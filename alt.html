            <b>Obfuscare</b> is a startup aiming to provide robust obfuscation for WebAssembly.
        </div>
        <div class="line">
            We will also provide ad-hoc automatic audio/video codec generation for multimedia content protection, with decoders for client devices in WebAssembly.
        </div>
        <div class="line">
            We believe WebAssembly is the future of the web, and seek to be the first-mover in this field.

        <header><h2>Next-generation obfuscation</h2></header>

        <div class="line">
            <b>Obfuscare</b> will provide a <i>holistic</i> obfuscation that intermingles all the executable code and data.
        </div>
        <div class="line">
            Using various techniques for introducing tight coupling between different segments of code and data,
            our obfuscator generates an executable in which <i>everything is coupled with everything via everything else</i>,
            difficult to disentangle.
        </div>
        <div class="line">
            Our approach is based on ad-hoc generation of virtual machine specification for each compilation,
            akin to <a href="https://github.com/airbus-seclab/warbirdvm">Warbird VM</a>.

        <div class="line">
            YouTube and <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/tree/master/youtube_dl/extractor">really a lot of other sites</a>
            currently provide multimedia content completely unencrypted.
        </div>
        <div class="line">
            We believe that in the WebAssembly age, this is no longer going to be the case.
        </div>
        <div class="line">
            We will provide a subscription to new multimedia codecs automatically generated from a random seed every day, with decoders for clients and encoders for servers.
